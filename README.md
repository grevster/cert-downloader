## Installation
I use poetry to manage the packages, you will need to install poetry and make sure it's in path before starting. You can download poetry from here.. https://python-poetry.org/

Once poetry is installed and you have cloned the repo, create a shell 'poetry shell' and install the packages ' poetry install'

## Envitoment Varibles
Make sure you add the token as an varible to your enviroment. Heres an example;

Where "XXXXXXXX" is your ipinfo token

You can register for a free account here.. https://ipinfo.io/ 

```
export IPINFO_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXX
```

For the current IP script (lookup-currentip.py) you do not need an access token.
