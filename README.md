## Installation
I use poetry to manage the packages, you will need to install poetry and make sure it's in path before starting. You can download poetry from here.. https://python-poetry.org/

Once poetry is installed and you have cloned the repo, create a shell 'poetry shell' and install the packages ' poetry install'
